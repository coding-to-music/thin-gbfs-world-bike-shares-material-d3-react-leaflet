A thin and low-network-use mobile web app for many common bike sharing systems.

I enjoy biking while I travel. Unfortunately, I have grown tired using many bloated web and native apps whilst using limited international data plans.

The goals of this project are:

- cache static assets (tiles, system lists, station lists) heavily on the client side.
- be able to access a large number of open data sources for various popular bike sharing systems.
- transmit data from server to app using a compact format.
- cache system and station information server side to avoid hitting the source data API's too often.
- limit number of TCP connections and number of hosts contacted
- use HTTPS
- privacy: the HTML5 geolocation APi is used, but the location is not transmitted elsewhere.

## Development

Get google cloud sdk, load in dependencies using `npm install`.

There are more common tasks listed `npm run`.

To run a dev server: `npm run dev` and open your browser to localhost:8080.
You will need to seed the DB by going to localhost:8000, then cron jobs and then run the only cron job.

## Software License Info

In order to minimize the number of TCP connections between the web app and the server, the dependencies have been webpacked together.

## Credits

This web app simple aggregates and transmits efficiently across the wire lots of very useful data provided by various entities:

- [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) - open API standard for (mostly large US) bike sharing systems
- [PyBikes](https://github.com/eskerda/pybikes) - a collection of various scrapers for various different API's
- [Citibik.es](https://api.citybik.es/) - api on top of pybikes

Thank you for your work!

Note: Since GBFS is an open standard, GBFS systems are hit directly rather than using Citibik.es.

### Data Errors

You will have to go to the respective projects / companies to their issue tracking systems. This project does not actually curate any data.
